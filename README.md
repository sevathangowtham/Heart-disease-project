Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease more accurately and efficiently.

Objectives
Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for machine learning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and visualize key features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train various machine learning models and evaluate their performance to select the best one.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identify the most significant features contributing to the prediction of heart disease.
Deployment: Create a deployable solution that can be used in a clinical setting for real-time prediction.
Methodology
Data Collection:

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which contains 303 records with 14 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and others.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform statistical analysis and visualization to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable.
Identify any correlations and patterns in the data.
Model Training:

Train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
Select the best-performing model based on these metrics.
Feature Importance Analysis:

Analyze the importance of each feature in the prediction using techniques like feature importance from tree-based models or coefficients from logistic regression.
Results
Best Model: The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 85% on the test set.
Key Features: The most important features identified were cp (chest pain type), thalach (maximum heart rate achieved), exang (exercise-induced angina), and oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest).
